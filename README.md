# Python Learning Journey

This repository contains my daily Python practice files.  
Each file covers one concept (variables, loops, functions, etc.) as I progress step by step.  

## Structure
- `Day01_Variables.py`
- `Day02_Strings.py`
- `Day03_Conditions.py`
- and so on...

## Goal
To build a strong foundation in Python for future projects in AI, ML, and Software Engineering.
