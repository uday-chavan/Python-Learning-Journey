# Operations in Strings

# arithmetic operations
# relational operations
# logical operations
# loops operations
# membership operations

# arithmetic operations
print("Hello" + "-" + "World")
print("*"*50)
# no other arithmetic operator will work

# relational operations
print("Hello" ==  "World")
print("Hello" != "World")
print("Mumbai" > "Pune")
# on the basis of lexiographical comparison

# logical operations 
"hello" and "world"
# says false to empty string
# says true to non empty string
"" or "World"
not "hello"

#loop operations
c = "Hello World"
for i in c[2:7:2]:
    print(i)
# can run loops easily

# membership operators (Checking)
'h' in c
'H' in c
"World" in c
